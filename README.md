# Lida_exp
Exploration of automated data visualization using Microsoft LIDA. MS Lida is a new open-source project by microsoft that provides a way to select an LLM (doesn't have to be OPENAI, HF models work as well) and with that and a streamlit app in this case, it enables people to upload their data file, ask a question to explore this data and this returns an automatically generated infographics using (seaborn etc.) that will answer your query.

## Getting Started
